This project is a collection of programming languages, with a base set of
algorithms and problems that is solved in each of the languages.

The problems are from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), and each
problem is solved by a single file in the programming language. This can be
used as comparison between the efficiency of the different languages, or as a
set of example programs in many different languages.

Each implementation of a problem is intended to have the same algorithmic
approach, so that the differences between the different languages are more
noticeable.

A description of the algorithmic for each problem is documented in the `docs/`
folder, along with more information about each language present.
